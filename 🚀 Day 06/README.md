# 🚀 Day 6/100 – Lists & List Comprehensions in Python 🧠🐍

Today’s focus was on **lists**, one of the most important and flexible data structures in Python, and **list comprehensions**, which help write clean and efficient code.

---

## 🔹 What I Learned

- What a list is and why it is used
- Creating lists and accessing elements using indexing
- Common list operations:
  - `append()`
  - `insert()`
  - `remove()`
  - `pop()`
- Iterating through lists using loops
- List slicing for accessing sub-parts of a list
- Nested lists (lists inside lists)
- List comprehensions for concise, one-line logic

---

## 🔹 Why Lists Are Important

- Store multiple values in a single variable
- Essential for problem-solving and data handling
- Widely used in real-world applications, data science, and machine learning
- Improve code readability and performance

---

## 🔹 Practice Covered

- Creating and modifying lists
- Filtering elements using conditions
- Generating new lists using list comprehensions
- Working with nested list structures

---

## 📌 Files Included

- `06_lists_&_list_comprehensions.py`
