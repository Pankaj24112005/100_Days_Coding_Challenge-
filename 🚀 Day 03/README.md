# 🚀 Day 3 – Operators in Python (All-in-One)

## 📌 Introduction
Day 3 focuses on **Operators in Python**, which are used to perform operations on variables and values.  
Operators are fundamental for writing logic, calculations, and decision-making programs.

## 🧠 Operators Covered

### 🔢 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical operations.
- `+` Addition  
- `-` Subtraction  
- `*` Multiplication  
- `/` Division  
- `%` Modulus  
- `**` Exponentiation  
- `//` Floor Division  

---

### 🔁 2️⃣ Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.
- `=`  
- `+=`  
- `-=`  
- `*=`  
- `/=`  
- `%=`  

---

### 🔍 3️⃣ Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values and return `True` or `False`.
- `==` Equal  
- `!=` Not equal  
- `>` Greater than  
- `<` Less than  
- `>=` Greater than or equal  
- `<=` Less than or equal  

---

### 🔗 4️⃣ Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements.
- `and`  
- `or`  
- `not`  

---

### 🆔 5️⃣ Identity Operators
Used to compare memory locations of objects.
- `is`  
- `is not`  

---

### 📦 6️⃣ Membership Operators
Used to test whether a value exists in a sequence.
- `in`  
- `not in`  

---

### ⚙️ 7️⃣ Bitwise Operators
Used to perform operations on binary numbers.
- `&` AND  
- `|` OR  
- `^` XOR  
- `~` NOT  
- `<<` Left shift  
- `>>` Right shift  

---

## 🧪 Concepts Practiced
- Performing calculations using operators
- Writing comparison and logical expressions
