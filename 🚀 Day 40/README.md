# 🚀 Day 40 – Apply, Map & Lambda Functions in Python 🐍📊

This repository contains hands-on examples of **Lambda functions**, **map()**, and **apply()** in Python, which are widely used for writing clean, efficient, and readable code—especially in **Data Analysis and Machine Learning workflows**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Lambda Functions
- Writing small anonymous functions in a single line
- Improving code readability
- Eliminating unnecessary function definitions

### 2️⃣ map() Function
- Applying a function to each element of an iterable
- Using `map()` with `lambda`
- Replacing traditional loops with functional programming

### 3️⃣ apply() Function (Pandas)
- Row-wise operations using `axis=1`
- Column-wise operations using `axis=0`
- Performing custom transformations on DataFrames

---

## 📊 Why This Matters
- Reduces boilerplate code
- Improves performance and clarity
- Essential for real-world **data preprocessing** and **feature engineering**
- Frequently used in **Data Science & ML projects**
