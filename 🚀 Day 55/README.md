# 🚀 Day 55 – SQL Case Study (LeetCode / Interview Style)

Welcome to **Day 55** of my **100 Days Coding Challenge**!  
Today’s focus was on solving **interview-style SQL case study problems** inspired by real-world scenarios and LeetCode-type questions.

Instead of basic queries, I practiced **logic-based SQL problems** that test data understanding, optimization, and analytical thinking.

## 📌 Topics Covered

✅ Subqueries  
✅ Common Table Expressions (CTE)  
✅ Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)  
✅ GROUP BY & HAVING  
✅ CASE Statements  
✅ Aggregation Functions  
✅ Interview Patterns (Second Highest Salary, Department-wise Max, etc.)

## 📊 Case Study Overview

A sample **employees** table was created with fields:

- emp_id  
- emp_name  
- department  
- salary  
- joining_date  

Using this dataset, I solved multiple interview-level problems including:

- Highest salary per department  
- Salary ranking  
- Employees earning above department average  
- Second highest salary  
- Department salary totals  
- Top 2 salaries using CTE  
- Employee count per department  
- Salary categorization using CASE

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- SQL interviews focus more on **logic than syntax**
- CTEs improve readability for complex queries
- Window functions simplify ranking problems
- CASE statements help in data classification
- Query optimization matters in real-world scenarios
