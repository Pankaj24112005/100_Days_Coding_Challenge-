# 🚀 Day 14/100 – Tuples in Python 🧠🐍

Today’s focus was on **Tuples**, a built-in Python data structure used to store ordered and immutable collections of items.

---

## 🔹 Topics Covered

- What is a tuple?
- Creating tuples
  - Empty tuple
  - Single-element tuple
  - Multiple-element tuple
  - Mixed data type tuple
- Accessing tuple elements
  - Indexing
  - Negative indexing
  - Slicing
- Nested tuples
- Tuple immutability
- Tuple packing and unpacking
- Built-in tuple methods
  - `count()`
  - `index()`
- Tuple vs List comparison
- Real-world use cases of tuples

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `14_tuples.py` – Python file containing all tuple examples and practice code

---

## 🔹 Why Use Tuples?

- Faster than lists
- Protects data from accidental modification
- Ideal for fixed data like coordinates, database records, and function returns

---

## 📌 Practice Goal

To understand **immutability** and learn when to prefer tuples over lists in real-world applications.
