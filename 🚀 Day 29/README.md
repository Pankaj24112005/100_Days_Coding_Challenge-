# 🚀 Day 29 – NumPy Broadcasting & Vectorization  
**100 Days of Coding Challenge**

This repository contains my learning and practice work for **Day 29**, focused on **NumPy Broadcasting and Vectorization**—two essential concepts for writing efficient numerical code in Python, especially for Data Science and Machine Learning.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Introduction to NumPy Broadcasting  
- Broadcasting rules (scalar, 1D, and 2D arrays)  
- Operations on arrays with different shapes  
- Vectorization vs traditional Python loops  
- Performance comparison (loop vs vectorized code)

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Broadcasting allows NumPy to operate on arrays of different shapes without explicit loops  
- Vectorized operations are significantly faster than Python loops  
- Cleaner, more readable, and scalable code  
- Strong foundation for libraries like **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch**
