# 🚀 Day 2 – Python Data Types (All-in-One)

## 📌 Introduction
Day 2 is focused on understanding **all major built-in data types in Python**.  
Data types tell Python **what kind of data** a variable holds and **how it should be handled** during program execution.

Python uses **dynamic typing**, meaning the data type is assigned automatically at runtime.

## 🧠 Data Types Covered in This File

### 🔢 Numeric Data Types
- **Integer (`int`)** – whole numbers  
- **Float (`float`)** – decimal numbers  
- **Complex (`complex`)** – numbers with real and imaginary parts  

---

### 📝 Text Data Type
- **String (`str`)** – sequence of characters

---

### 🔘 Boolean Data Type
- **Boolean (`bool`)** – `True` or `False`

---

### 📦 Collection Data Types
- **List (`list`)** – ordered and mutable  
- **Tuple (`tuple`)** – ordered and immutable  
- **Set (`set`)** – unordered and unique values  
- **Dictionary (`dict`)** – key-value pairs  

---

### 🚫 Special Data Type
- **NoneType (`None`)** – represents absence of a value

---

## 🧪 Concepts Practiced
- Variable creation
- Assigning different data types
- Printing values and their types using `type()`
- Understanding mutable vs immutable data types
- Observing Python’s dynamic typing behavior

---

## 🎯 Why Data Types Are Important
- Help Python manage memory efficiently
- Prevent logical and runtime errors
- Essential for writing clean and correct code
- Frequently tested in interviews and exams
