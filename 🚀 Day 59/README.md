🚀 Day 59 – Bivariate Analysis
📌 100 Days Coding Challenge
📊 Project Overview

On Day 59, I performed Bivariate Analysis on the Titanic Dataset to understand relationships between two variables and how they influence survival outcomes.

Bivariate analysis is a crucial part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and helps identify patterns, correlations, and dependencies between features.

📁 Dataset Used

Dataset: Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster
Source: Kaggle

File Used:

train.csv

Columns in Dataset
PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age,
SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked

🔍 Types of Bivariate Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Numerical vs Numerical

Age vs Fare

Scatter Plot

Correlation Matrix

📌 Insight:

Weak correlation between Age and Fare.

2️⃣ Categorical vs Numerical

Sex vs Fare

Pclass vs Age

Boxplots

Group Mean Comparison

📌 Insights:

Females paid slightly different fare distribution compared to males.

Passengers in Pclass 1 had higher average age.

3️⃣ Categorical vs Categorical

Sex vs Survived

Pclass vs Survived

Crosstab

Heatmap Visualization

📌 Key Findings:

Females had significantly higher survival rate.

Passengers in Pclass 1 survived more compared to Pclass 3.

Fare appears positively associated with survival probability.

📈 Visualizations Used

🎯 Key Learnings

✔ Difference between Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
✔ Identifying feature–target relationships
✔ Using visual tools for better insight
✔ Importance of categorical interactions
✔ Preparing data understanding before ML modeling

📌 Conclusion

Bivariate analysis helped uncover strong relationships between:

Sex → Survived

Pclass → Survived

Fare → Survival likelihood

These features are highly important for building predictive models on the Titanic dataset.
