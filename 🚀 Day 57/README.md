echo "# 🚀 Day 57 – Data Cleaning for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on Data Cleaning, one of the most crucial steps in the Data Science pipeline. Using an employee salary dataset, I performed structured preprocessing to make the data EDA-ready. This is part of my 100 Days Coding Challenge.

## 📂 Dataset Columns
Id, EmployeeName, JobTitle, BasePay, OvertimePay, OtherPay, Benefits, TotalPay, TotalPayBenefits, Year, Agency, Status

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed
- Removed irrelevant columns  
- Dropped duplicates  
- Converted salary columns to numeric  
- Filled missing values (median/mode)  
- Cleaned text columns  
- Removed negative salaries  
- Treated outliers using IQR  

## 🧰 Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Key Learning
EDA is only as good as the data behind it — garbage in, garbage out.
