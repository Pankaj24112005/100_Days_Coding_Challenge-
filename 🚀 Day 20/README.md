# 🐍 Snake Water Gun Game – Python Mini Project

This is a simple **Snake 🐍 Water 💧 Gun 🔫** game built using Python as part of my **#100DaysOfCode challenge (Day 20)**.

The game is played between the **user and the computer**, where the computer randomly chooses one option and the result is decided based on predefined rules.

## 📌 Game Rules

- Snake 🐍 drinks Water 💧 → **Snake Wins**
- Water 💧 disables Gun 🔫 → **Water Wins**
- Gun 🔫 kills Snake 🐍 → **Gun Wins**
- Same choice → **Draw**

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

- Python `random` module  
- Dictionaries for mapping choices  
- Conditional statements  
- Input validation  
- Clean and optimized logic

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the Python file
2. Enter your choice:
   - `snake` for Snake
   - `water` for Water
   - `gun` for Gun
3. The computer will randomly choose its option
4. The result (Win / Lose / Draw) will be displayed

## 🧠 Logic Used

Each option is assigned a number:
- Snake → `1`
- Water → `-1`
- Gun → `0`

The result is calculated using the difference between the computer's choice and the user's choice, making the logic simple and efficient.
