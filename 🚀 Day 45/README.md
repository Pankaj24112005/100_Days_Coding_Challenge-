# 🚀 Day 45 – Statistical Plots (Box, Violin & Distribution) 📊🐍

This project is part of my **100 Days of Coding Challenge**, where I explore data science and machine learning concepts step by step.

## 📌 Topic
**Statistical Plots for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Understanding data distribution is a crucial step before applying any machine learning model. In this notebook, I explored commonly used statistical plots using Python.

## 🔍 Plots Covered

### 📦 Box Plot
- Shows median, quartiles, and spread of data
- Helps in identifying **outliers**

### 🎻 Violin Plot
- Combines box plot with **probability density**
- Useful for comparing distributions

### 📊 Distribution Plot
- Histogram with KDE (Kernel Density Estimation)
- Helps understand the **shape and spread** of data

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 🐍
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `Day_45_Statistical_Plots.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with code & visualizations
- `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## ✅ Key Learnings
- Visualizing data helps uncover hidden patterns
- Box plots are great for spotting outliers
- Violin plots show both distribution and statistics
- Distribution plots help understand data behavior
