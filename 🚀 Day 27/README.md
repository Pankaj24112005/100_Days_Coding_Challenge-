# 🚀 Day 27 – NumPy: Array Properties, Indexing, Slicing & Reshaping

This repository documents my **Day 27 learning** as part of my continuous Python & Data Science journey.  
Today’s focus was on **core NumPy array operations**, which are fundamental for data analysis and machine learning.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔹 NumPy Array Basics
- Creating 1D and 2D NumPy arrays
- Understanding NumPy’s advantages over Python lists

### 🔹 Array Properties
- `shape` – dimensions of the array  
- `ndim` – number of dimensions  
- `size` – total elements  
- `dtype` – data type of elements  

### 🔹 Indexing & Slicing
- Accessing individual elements
- Row-wise and column-wise indexing
- Slicing arrays efficiently

### 🔹 Reshaping Arrays
- `reshape()` – change array dimensions
- `flatten()` – convert to 1D (copy)
- `ravel()` – convert to 1D (view)

### 🔹 Array Manipulation
- Transpose (`.T`)
- Element-wise operations
- Copy vs View (deep vs shallow copy)
