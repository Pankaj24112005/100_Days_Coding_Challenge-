# Day 63 – Probability Basics  

Part of my **#100DaysCodingChallenge**  

Today’s focus was on understanding **Probability Fundamentals**, which form the backbone of Statistics, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

---

##  Topics Covered  

- What is Probability  
- Sample Space & Events  
- Classical Probability  
- Independent Events  
- Empirical Probability (Simulation using Python)  
- Visualization of Dice Roll Distribution  

---

##  Key Learnings  

Probability helps quantify uncertainty and is heavily used in:  

- Machine Learning Algorithms  
- Predictive Modeling  
- Risk Analysis  
- Data Interpretation  

Through hands-on Python examples, I practiced calculating probabilities and simulated real-world scenarios like dice rolls.

##  Visualization  

A histogram is used to visualize the distribution of dice rolls, helping understand frequency and randomness.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used  

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Matplotlib  
- Random module  

---

## Files Included  

- `Day_63_Probability_Basics.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing theory + code  
- `README.md` – Project documentation
