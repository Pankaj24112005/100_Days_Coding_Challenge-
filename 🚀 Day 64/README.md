# 📊 Day 64 – Normal Distribution

This project is part of my **#100DaysCodingChallenge** where I explore core concepts of Data Science and Machine Learning.

On Day 64, I studied and visualized the **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)** using Python.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To understand:

- What Normal Distribution is  
- Mean and Standard Deviation  
- Bell Curve properties  
- How to visualize a normal distribution using Python  

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `Day64_Normal_Distribution.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with implementation and visualization

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- SciPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 What’s Inside the Notebook

✅ Generated random normally distributed data  
✅ Plotted histogram of data  
✅ Fitted Gaussian curve  
✅ Calculated Mean & Standard Deviation  
✅ Visualized Bell Curve  
✅ Added conclusion  

---

## 📌 Key Learnings

- Normal Distribution forms a bell-shaped curve  
- Mean, Median, and Mode are equal  
- Standard Deviation controls spread  
- Widely used in statistics, ML, and data analysis
