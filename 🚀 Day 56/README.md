# 🚀 Day 56 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains my **Day 56** work from the *100 Days Coding Challenge*, focused on understanding **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — a crucial step in every Data Science project.

EDA helps uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test assumptions, and prepare data for Machine Learning models.

## 📌 What is EDA?

Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of:

✅ Understanding dataset structure  
✅ Handling missing & duplicate values  
✅ Studying feature distributions  
✅ Detecting outliers  
✅ Analyzing relationships between variables  
✅ Preparing clean data for modeling  

Good EDA leads to **better feature engineering and stronger ML models.**
