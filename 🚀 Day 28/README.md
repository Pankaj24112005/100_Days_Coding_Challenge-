# 🚀 Day 28: NumPy Mathematical & Axis Operations

This repository contains my **Day 28 learning progress** from the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**, focused on **mathematical operations and axis-based computations using NumPy**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Mathematical Operations
- Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Power operations on NumPy arrays
- Faster computations without using explicit loops

### 🔹 Universal Functions (ufuncs)
- `np.sqrt()` – Square root
- `np.log()` – Logarithmic operations
- `np.exp()` – Exponential values
- `np.sin()` and `np.cos()` – Trigonometric functions

### 🔹 Axis Operations
- Column-wise operations using `axis=0`
- Row-wise operations using `axis=1`
- Aggregation functions:
  - `sum()`
  - `mean()`
  - `min()`
  - `max()`
