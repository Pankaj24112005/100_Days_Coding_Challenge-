# 🚀 Day 10 – Encapsulation & Instance Methods (Python)

## 📌 Topic Overview
Day 10 focuses on **Encapsulation**, one of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and the use of **instance methods** in Python.

Encapsulation helps protect data by restricting direct access and allowing interaction only through defined methods.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 Encapsulation
- Wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class)
- Helps in data protection and controlled access
- Improves code maintainability and security

### 🔹 Access Modifiers in Python
- **Public** → Accessible everywhere  
  Example: `self.name`
- **Protected** → Accessible within class & subclasses  
  Example: `self._age`
- **Private** → Accessible only within the class  
  Example: `self.__balance`

### 🔹 Instance Methods
- Methods that operate on object data
- Use `self` to access instance variables
- Allow objects to perform actions on their own data

---

## 🧪 Example Covered
- Bank Account system
- Private balance variable
- Getter and setter-like methods
- Deposit and withdrawal operations
- Real-world encapsulation analogy

---

## 🎯 Why Encapsulation Matters
- Prevents accidental data modification
- Controls how data is accessed or changed
- Essential for scalable and secure applications
- Frequently asked in interviews
