Day 4 – Conditional Statements & Loops (Flow Control) 🐍
1) Overview
   On Day 4 of my 100 Days of Coding Challenge, I focused on flow control in Python, which helps programs make decisions and repeat tasks efficiently.

2) Topics Covered
   i) Conditional Statements
      if
      elif
      else
   ii) Loops
      for loop
      while loop
      Loop Control Statements
      break
      continue
      pass
3) Key Learnings
   i)  How Python executes code based on conditions
   ii) How loops reduce repetitive code
   iii)How break and continue control loop execution
   iv) Building basic logic for real-world problems

4) Practice Programs Included
   Voting eligibility check
   Grade calculation using if-elif-else
   Printing numbers using for and while loops
   Examples of break, continue, and pass
