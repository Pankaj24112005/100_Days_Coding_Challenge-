# 🚀 Day 54 – SQL Window Functions  
Part of my **#100DaysCodingChallenge**

Today I explored one of the most powerful features in SQL — **Window Functions**, which allow performing calculations across related rows while preserving individual records.

## 📌 Topics Covered

✅ ROW_NUMBER()  
✅ RANK()  
✅ DENSE_RANK()  
✅ LAG()  
✅ LEAD()  
✅ PARTITION BY  
✅ ORDER BY inside OVER()  
✅ Running Total / Cumulative Sum

## 💡 Key Learning

Window functions help solve advanced analytical problems such as:

✔ Ranking employees by salary  
✔ Finding previous / next row values  
✔ Calculating running totals  
✔ Performing analytics without GROUP BY  
✔ Comparing values across rows  

These concepts are essential for **real-world Data Analysis and Data Science workflows**.
