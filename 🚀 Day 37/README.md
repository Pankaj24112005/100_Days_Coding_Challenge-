# 🚀 Day 37 – Datetime Handling with Pandas 🕒🐍

Datetime handling is a crucial skill in data analysis, data science, and machine learning—especially when working with logs, transactions, and time-series data.

On **Day 37** of my **100 Days of Code – Data Science Journey**, I focused on mastering date and time operations using **Pandas**.
