## 📌 Topics Covered

- `head()` – View the first few rows of the dataset  
- `info()` – Understand data types, non-null counts, and memory usage  
- `describe()` – Get statistical summary of numerical features  

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Quickly identify missing values  
- Detect incorrect data types  
- Understand feature distributions  
- Ensure data quality before preprocessing and modeling  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook
