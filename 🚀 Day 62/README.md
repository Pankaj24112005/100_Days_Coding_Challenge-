# Day 62 – Variance & Standard Deviation  
### 100 Days Coding Challenge  

## Overview  

On Day 62 of my #100DaysCodingChallenge, I explored two fundamental statistical concepts used in Data Science and Machine Learning:

- Variance  
- Standard Deviation  

These metrics help measure how spread out data points are from the mean and are essential for understanding data variability.

## Concepts Covered  

### Mean  
The average value of a dataset.

### Variance  
Measures how far each number in the dataset is from the mean.

Formula:  
Variance = Σ(x − μ)² / N  

### Standard Deviation  
Square root of variance.  
It tells us how much data typically deviates from the mean.

Standard Deviation = √Variance

## Tools Used  

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib

## What This Notebook Includes  

✔ Creating a sample dataset  
✔ Calculating Mean, Variance & Standard Deviation using NumPy  
✔ Calculating using Pandas  
✔ Histogram visualization with labels  
✔ Clear explanation of results

## Why This Matters in Data Science  

Variance and Standard Deviation are important for:

- Understanding data distribution  
- Detecting outliers  
- Measuring volatility  
- Feature scaling  
- Improving Machine Learning models  

Strong statistical foundations lead to better model building.
