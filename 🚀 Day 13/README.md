# Day 13 – Strings in Python 🧵🐍

## 📌 Overview
On Day 13 of my **100 Days of Coding Challenge**, I learned about **Strings** in Python — one of the most important data types used for handling text and user input.

Strings are **immutable**, meaning once created, they cannot be changed. Understanding strings is essential for real-world applications like data processing, automation, and backend development.
