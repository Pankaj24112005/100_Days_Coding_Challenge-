# Day 18 – Number Patterns (Part 2) 🔢🐍

On Day 18 of my #100DaysOfCode Python learning journey, I practiced number-based pattern printing to strengthen my logic-building skills and understanding of nested loops. These exercises helped me improve number sequencing, spacing, and problem-solving ability, which are important for coding interviews and DSA preparation.

Concepts covered today include nested for loops, number sequencing, reverse looping, palindrome logic, spacing and alignment, and pattern-based problem solving.

The number patterns implemented in this day are:

1) Increasing Number Triangle
1
12
123
1234

2) Repeated Number Pattern
1
22
333
4444

3) Floyd’s Number Triangle
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10

4) Reverse Number Pattern
1234
123
12
1

5) Right-Aligned Number Pattern
   1
  12
 123
1234

6) Palindrome Number Pattern
1
121
12321
1234321

To run the program, use the following command:
python 18_number_patterns.py

Learning outcomes from Day 18 include improved loop control, stronger logical thinking, better confidence in solving pattern problems, and a solid foundation for DSA and interview preparation.
