# 🚀 Day 34 – Handling Missing Values | 100DaysOfCode

Handling missing values is a critical step in data preprocessing. Poor handling can lead to biased analysis and weak machine learning models.  
In **Day 34** of my **100DaysOfCode** journey, I focused on understanding *why missing values occur* and *how to treat them effectively using Pandas*.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- What are missing values and why they matter
- Identifying missing values using:
  - `isnull()`
  - `sum()`
- Types of missing data:
  - MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)
  -. MAR (Missing At Random)
  - MNAR (Missing Not At Random)

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Implemented

- Dropping missing values:
  - `dropna()`
- Filling missing values:
  - Mean imputation
  - Median imputation
  - Mode imputation
- Forward Fill (`ffill`)
- Backward Fill (`bfill`)

## 📂 Files Included

- `Day_34_Handling_Missing_Values_100DaysOfCode.ipynb`  
  → Jupyter Notebook with code examples and explanations

## 💡 Key Takeaway

There is **no one-size-fits-all** method for handling missing values.  
The right approach depends on:
- Data distribution
- Feature importance
- Business or problem context

Proper handling of missing data leads to **cleaner datasets and more reliable ML models**.
