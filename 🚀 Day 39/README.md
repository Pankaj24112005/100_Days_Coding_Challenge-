# 🚀 Day 39 – Merge, Join & Concatenate with Pandas 📊🐍

This repository contains my **Day 39** learning from the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**, focused on combining datasets using **Pandas** — an essential skill in data analysis and machine learning workflows.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Merge
- Combining DataFrames using common columns
- SQL-style joins:
  - Inner Join
  - Left Join
  - Right Join
  - Outer Join

### 🔹 Join
- Index-based DataFrame joining
- Useful when working with indexed datasets

### 🔹 Concatenate
- Vertical concatenation (row-wise)
- Horizontal concatenation (column-wise)
- Combining multiple DataFrames efficiently

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Difference between `merge()`, `join()`, and `concat()`
- When to use each method in real-world scenarios
- Handling missing values after joins
- Structuring clean and readable data pipelines

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `Day_39_Merge_Join_Concat.ipynb` → Hands-on Jupyter Notebook with examples

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

---

## 📈 Why This Matters
Merge, Join, and Concatenate operations are widely used in:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Combining datasets from multiple sources
- Real-world analytics and ML projects

---

## 🔗 Part of My Journey
This notebook is part of my **#100DaysOfCoding** challenge where I learn and share Python, Pandas, and Data Science concepts daily.

👉 Stay tuned for upcoming days!
