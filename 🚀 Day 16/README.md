# Day 16 – Sets and Relations in Python 🐍

## 📌 Overview
On **Day 16** of my **100 Days Coding Challenge**, I learned about **Sets and Relations in Python**.  
Sets are used to store **unique elements**, while relations help represent **mathematical relationships** using sets and tuples.

## 📖 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Sets in Python
- Creating sets
- Adding and removing elements
- Set operations:
  - Union
  - Intersection
  - Difference
  - Symmetric Difference
- Membership testing
- Removing duplicate elements from a list using sets

### 🔹 Relations in Python
- Understanding relations as a **set of ordered pairs**
- Representing relations using tuples
- Finding:
  - Domain of a relation
  - Range of a relation
- Checking whether a pair exists in a relation

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Sets automatically remove duplicate values
- Set operations are very useful in **DSA, Data Science, and AI**
- Relations can be efficiently modeled using sets and tuples in Python
