# 📊 Day 61 – Mean, Median & Mode  
### 100 Days Coding Challenge 🚀  

## 📌 Overview  
On Day 61, I explored Measures of Central Tendency — one of the most fundamental concepts in Statistics and Data Science.

Understanding Mean, Median, and Mode is essential before moving into Machine Learning because these measures help summarize data and understand its distribution.

## 📚 Topics Covered  

### Mean  
- The average of all values  
- Sensitive to outliers  

### Median  
- The middle value after sorting  
- Robust against outliers  

### Mode  
- Most frequently occurring value  
- Useful for categorical data  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Project Structure  

Day66_Mean_Median_Mode.ipynb  
README.md  

## 🎯 Key Learning  
- Mean changes when outliers exist  
- Median handles skewed data well  
- Mode shows frequency patterns  

## 🚀 Conclusion  
Strong statistical foundations are critical for Data Science and Machine Learning.
