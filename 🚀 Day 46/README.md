# 🚀 Day 46 – Heatmaps & Pairplots 📊🐍

This project is part of my **100 Days of Coding – Data Science Journey**.

## 📌 Objective
To explore relationships between numerical features using **Heatmaps** and **Pairplots**, which are essential techniques in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 🐍
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Iris Dataset**
- Loaded using `seaborn.load_dataset("iris")`

---

## 📈 Visualizations Performed

### 🔥 Heatmap
- Displays correlation between numerical features
- Helps identify strong relationships and multicollinearity

### 🔗 Pairplot
- Shows pairwise relationships between features
- Color-coded by species
- Useful for understanding data distribution and class separation

---

## 🔍 Key Observations
- Strong correlation between **petal length** and **petal width**
- Species are clearly separable using petal features
- Visualizations make data patterns easy to interpret

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Heatmaps and pairplots are powerful visualization tools that help uncover hidden patterns in data and form a strong foundation before applying machine learning models.
