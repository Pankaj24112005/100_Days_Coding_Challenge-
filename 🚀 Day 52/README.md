# 🚀 Day 52 – SQL JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)

As part of my **100 Days Coding Challenge**, Day 52 was focused on one of the most important and practical concepts in SQL — **JOINS**.

Joins allow us to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns, which is essential for real-world data analysis and database querying.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔹 INNER JOIN
- Returns only the rows that have matching values in **both tables**.

### 🔹 LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
- Returns **all rows from the left table** and matching rows from the right table.
- If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the right table.

### 🔹 RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
- Returns **all rows from the right table** and matching rows from the left table.
- If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the left table.

### 🔹 FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
- Returns **all rows from both tables**, with NULLs where there is no match.
