# 🚀 Day 60 – Multivariate Analysis & Feature Insights (Titanic Dataset)

This project is part of my **100 Days Coding Challenge**, where I focus on building strong foundations in **Data Science and Machine Learning** through hands-on practice.

On Day 60, I performed **Multivariate Analysis** on the Titanic dataset to understand how multiple features interact together and influence passenger survival.

## 📌 Objectives

- Perform multivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Study relationships between multiple variables
- Visualize feature–target interactions
- Apply feature encoding
- Generate correlation heatmaps
- Use Random Forest to extract feature importance
- Derive meaningful insights for feature selection

## 🔍 Workflow

1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Handled missing values (Age, Embarked)  
3. Applied one-hot encoding on categorical features  
4. Performed multivariate correlation analysis  
5. Visualized feature vs target using boxplot subplots  
6. Generated pairplots for feature interaction  
7. Built a Random Forest model  
8. Extracted and visualized feature importance

## 🔑 Key Insights

1. Gender and passenger class emerged as the strongest survival indicators.  
2. Fare and Age showed meaningful relationships with survival probability.  
3. Multivariate analysis and feature importance highlighted **Sex, Fare, Pclass, and Age** as the most impactful predictors.

## ✅ Conclusion

Successfully applied multivariate analysis to uncover key feature interactions, identified the most influential variables affecting survival, and built a strong foundation for feature engineering before machine learning modeling.
