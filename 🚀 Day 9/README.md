🚀 Day 9 – OOP Pillars: Inheritance & Types of Inheritance 🧠🐍
📌 Topic Covered

Inheritance is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It allows a class (child) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (parent), promoting code reusability, maintainability, and structured design.

🔹 What is Inheritance?

Inheritance enables one class to reuse the methods and attributes of another class, reducing code duplication and improving scalability.

🔹 Types of Inheritance Covered
1️⃣ Single Inheritance

One child class inherits from one parent class.

2️⃣ Multiple Inheritance

One child class inherits from more than one parent class.

3️⃣ Multilevel Inheritance

A chain of inheritance where a class is derived from another derived class.

4️⃣ Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.

5️⃣ Hybrid Inheritance

A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

💡 Quote of the Day

“Inheritance lets you build on what already exists instead of starting from scratch.”
